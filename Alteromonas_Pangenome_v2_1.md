# Alteromonas Genus Pangenome, version 2.1.0

**Date:** August 2023

**Primary Author:** Michelle DeMers

In this edition of the pangenome, we added three new genomes to the database of *Alteromonas* genomes. 

One of these genomes is from a recently published paper: *Alteromonas fortis ALFOR1*. The paper is [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31199221/) and the assembly information and sequence can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_903772925.1/?shouldredirect=false).

The other two genomes are MAGs from work that Dr. Coco Koedooder did in studying *Alteromonas macleodii* associated with *Trichodesmium*. The first MAG, *Alteromonas macleodii MAG10 Ficus* is from the microbial consortium of *Trichodesmium* colonies from [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.15.532517v1). The second MAG, *Alteromonas macleodii MAG31*, is also from *Trichodesmium* colonies, this time of those from the Red Sea.

The same annotation, pangenome curation, phylogenomic analysis, and synthesis steps were completed as in previous versions, just with these genomes added. An important note is that the bayesian core gene clusters were retrieved using an alternate version of the pangenome, one with no singletons, so that it would be computational less intensive than using the larger pangenome above.
